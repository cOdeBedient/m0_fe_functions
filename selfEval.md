# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?  
***This was a long exercise, but I learned a lot. I think being thorough and precise is really important, which requires a lot of pateince and concentration. I was happy that I slowed down a number of times to make my work more detailed. I also was proud of myself for trying out some methods that felt a little over my head to see if I could make sense of them.***
- In your own words, why are functions a powerful tool in our applications?
***They can save so much time! Once we write a good, elegant function (or find one that has been written), calling the function over and over will be SO much easier than typing out the entire process we are trying to achieve each time. And functions could be big, but distilled down to a single word when we call them. I'm excited to learn more.***
